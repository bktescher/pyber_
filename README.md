# PyBer Ride Sharing Challenge

## Overview
The PyBer ride sharing company has tasked us with compiling data for three city type demographics: Urban, Suburban and Rural.

## Pyber Stats by Demographic

##### Rides, Drivers and Average Fares
The Urban city type contains the most rides, drivers and total fares.  Suburban has less of the three indicators and Rural has even less.  However, a reciprocal effect was noted in Average fares/per driver.  Urban had lower average fares/per driver, Suburban had slightly more and Rural had even more.  

## Weekly Pivot: Fares by City

##### Weekly Insights = Inconclusive

The weekly insights follow the same trends as the general analysis: Urban utilization is highest followed by Suburban then Rural.  From the line graph provided, each demographic seems to utilize our rides at the same times which are probably related to Holidays/Events e.g. New Years, Valentines, St. Paddy's day.

Further insights into timing data will require more data collection and subsequent analysis for trend identification.

## Overview
It's apparent that Rural and Suburban riders take longer trips which cause the fares to be higher.  One could also surmise that these demographics also take less trips due to their higher cost.  It would be interesting to collect further information as to why customers choose to ride share.

##### Why do customers use Pyber?
- Pyber as substitute for vehicle?
- Pyber utilized when vehicle is unavailable?
- Safe travel for Holiday/Celebrations?

Thank you for allowing us to provide your company with this analysis.  We look forward to our continued partnership.  Be well and ride safe.
